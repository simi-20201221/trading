## [Binance: The Psychology of Market Cycles](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/the-psychology-of-market-cycles)

### What is market psychology?

- `Market psychology` is the idea that the movements of a market reflect (or are influenced by) `the emotional state of its participants`.
- `Psychological market cycles` created from `the overall fluctuating investor sentiment`.
- => Market [sentiment](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/sentiment) is the overall feeling that investors and traders have regarding the price action of an asset.
  - [Bull market](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/bull-market) is when the market's sentiment is positive, and prices are rising continuously, there is said to be a bullish trend.
  - [Bear market](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/bear-market) is when the market's sentiment is negative, and prices are reducing continuously, there is said to be a bearish trend.
  - [Market indexes](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/index)
  - [Market Capitalization](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/market-capitalization)
    - `Market Cap = Current Price x Circulating Supply`
    - `volume` relates to the number of assets exchanged within a certain period
    - [liquidity](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/liquidity-explained) is basically the degree to which the asset can be quickly bought or sold without causing too much impact on the price. 

### How do emotions change during market cycles?

#### Uptrend

- expansion phase
  - a bull market
  - a climate of optimism, belief, and greed
  - => `strong buying activity`
- a strong sense of greed and belief overtakes the market`
  - => `financial bubble`
  - => many `investors` become `irrational`, losing sight of the `actual value` and buying an asset only because they believe the market will continue to rise
- as the price gets overextended to the upside
  - => `the local top` is created
  - => `point of maximum financial risk`
- the `market` will experience a `sideways` movement for a while as the assets are gradually sold
  - => `distribution stage`
- some cycles do not present a clear `distribution stage`, and the `downtrend` starts soon after the top is reached.

#### Downtrend

- the market starts to turn the other way
  - the euphoric mood can quickly turn into complacency
  - many `traders` refuse to `believe` that the `uptrend is over`
  - `prices` continue to `decline`
  - the `market` sentiment quickly moves to the `negative` side. (It often includes feelings of anxiety, denial, and panic.)
- `prices` `drop` even further, the wave of `selling` gets `stronger`
  - [capitulation](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/capitulation): when holders give up and sell their assets close to the local bottom
- the `downtrend stops` as the [volatility](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/volatility) decreases and the `market stabilizes`
- the `market` experiences `sideways` movements before feelings of hope and optimism start arising once again
  - => such `sideways period` is also known as the `accumulation stage`.


### How do investors use market psychology?

- the moment of `highest financial opportunity` (for a `buyer`) usually comes when `most people are hopeless` and the `market` is `very low`
- the moment of `highest financial risk` often arises when the majority of the `market participants` are `euphoric` and `overconfident`


### Technical analysis and market psychology

- Understand how the market is changing and predict what comes next
  - [Fundamental analysis (FA)](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/fundamental-analysis)
    - examining as most qualitative and quantitative factors as possible
      - company management and reputation
      - industry health
      - market capitalization, and other economic factors
    - => the goal of fundamental analysis is to `determine` whether or not the price of an asset is `overvalued` or `undervalued`

  - [Technical analysis (TA)](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-technical-analysis)
    - To attempt to anticipate where the market is likely to go.
    - `TA` indicators used when trying to measure the `psychological state of the market`
- Example
  - The Relative Strength Index ([RSI](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-the-rsi-indicator)) indicator may suggest when an asset is overbought due to a strong positive market sentiment (e.g., excessive greed)
  - The [MACD](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/macd-indicator-explained) indicator used to `spot` the `different psychological stages` of a `market cycle`
- Fear Of Missing Out ([FOMO](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/fear-of-missing-out))
- Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt ([FUD](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/fear-uncertainty-and-doubt))
