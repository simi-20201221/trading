### Practice

1. Set up an exchange account (if you don’t have one already). I would recommend Binance for anyone outside the US. Once that’s done, start looking at the order book and order types (without making actual orders).
2. Set up a TradingView account and looking at charts. It doesn’t matter if you don’t understand much, try to get more familiar with the TradingView interface. Change your time frame, change your pairs (for example, BTC/USD, ETH/USD), and so on. Add a few indicators to see how they work.
3. Start finding some Crypto news websites that you trust and bookmark them. Check them once or twice a day and keep up to speed with developments in the Crypto world.
4. Below is a list of Youtube channels with good information. Follow these channels and watch some video’s if you’re up for it!

### Classic Patterns

#### Rules

1. The more isolated a pattern is vertically, the greater its reliability.
2. The overwhelming vast majority of patterns will fail.
3. Patterns on intraday graphs are even more susceptible to failure.
4. Patterns on weekly charts are the most reliable.
5. Horizontal patterns are far more reliable than diagonal patterns.

### Harmonic Patterns

- Do not use harmonic patterns, because they try to predict the future.

### Practice

1. Starting looking at charts. First, determine the overall trend. Is it in an uptrend, or a downtrend? Use trend lines on the 1-day chart.
2. After you’ve established the overall trend, try to find patterns on 1-day charts. Look at both candle sticks and classic patterns. Is there anything interesting you can spot? How long did it take for these patterns to form?
3. What was the result? Example, if you found a descending triangle during a downtrend, did the trend continue like is often expected? Document your findings and move on to the next pattern.
4. Repeat for any number of times, and try it out with different pairs and different time frames. Do you see a decrease in accuracy when you switch to a 1-hour time frame, par example? An increase when you switch to a weekly time frame?
5. Try to find patterns that are currently still being played out, write down what you think will happen based on what you know, and keep an eye on them for a the next few days. Once you get your answer, evaluate your predictions and if they were correct or incorrect.
