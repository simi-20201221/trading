### Support and Resistance

- [Support](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/support)
  - support level
  - the price continually entered an area where the asset was bought up
  - a support range was formed as the area was retested multiple times
  - and since the bears (sellers) were unable to push the price further down, it eventually bounced – potentially starting a new uptrend
  - Price bouncing in an area of support before a breakout
  - ![Support](./support.png)
- [Resistance](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/resistance)
  - resistance level
  - the price was in a downtrend, but after each bounce, it failed to break through the same area multiple times
  - the resistance level is formed because the bulls (buyers) were unable to gain control of the market and drive the price higher, causing the downtrend to continue
