## Order Types

### Market Order and Limit Order

- Market Order
  - Purchases an asset at the `market price`
  - Fills immediately
  - Manual
- Limit Order
  - Purchases an asset at a set `price or better`
  - Fills only at the limit order’s price or better
  - Can be set in advance
  - To place a `limit order`, need to set a `maximum` or `minimum` price willing to `buy` or `sell` an asset

### Stop-loss and Stop-limit order

- A `stop-loss` order is a market order that triggers when the market reaches your `stop price`.
  - It’s an order to `buy` or `sell` a `coin` at the `market price` once the coin price `hits` the `stop price` you set.
  - When `triggered`, a `stop-loss` order turns into a `market order` and executes at the `current market price`.
    - If the `stop price` is `not reached`, your order will `not be executed`.
    - used to minimize potential losses in case the market moves against your position.
    - used as a `take-profit` order to exit a position and protect unrealized profits.
    - Buy stop orders can also be used to enter the market at a `lower price`.
- The `stop-loss` order, after triggered, will create a `market order`.
- The `stop-limit` order, after triggered, will create a `limit order`.
- When to use a limit order?
    - want to `buy` at a specific price `below` the `current market price`, or `sell` at a specific price `above` the `current market price`
    - not in a hurry to buy or sell immediately
    - want to lock unrealized profits or minimize potential losses
    - want to split your orders into smaller limit orders to achieve a dollar-cost-averaging (DCA) effect.
